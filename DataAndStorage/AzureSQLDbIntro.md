## Azure SQL Database

1. Deployment
  - Options
    - Physical
    - Virtual
    - Infrastructure as a Service
      - Used to Lift-and-shift SQL Server workloads
      - for applications that require OS level access
      - Alternative to purchasing hardware
      - Useful if other elements of the application are already in Azure
      - Gives more administrative control of the SQL engine
    - Platform as a Service
      - Managed Instance
        - allows a group of databases to be used together
        - closest to an IaaS offering
        - supports almost all on-premises instance-level and database0level capabilities
        - every managed instance has its own guaranteed resources
        - built-in backups patching and recovery
        - private IP address within Azure Virtual Network
        - up to 8TB
      - Single Instance 
        - each database receives its own guaranteed
          - compute
          - memory
          - storage
        - little administration required
      - elastic pool
        - collection of single databases with a shared set of resources such as CPU and memory
        - fixed amount of resources are shared by all databases in the pool
        - cost-effective method for managing several databases or building applications that can take advantage of these elastic features
   - best for
     - Modern cloud applications
     - The latest stable SQL Server features
     - Time constraints in development time
     - 99.99% availability guaranteed
     - Built-in backups patching recovery
     - Serverless Compute options
   - other benefits
     - protection with intelligent advanced thread detection
     - proactive vulnerability assessment alerts
     - compliance evaluation to make sure your service is adhering to industry standards
     - cost and the ability to yse abd pay for only what you need
     - reduced administrative overhead
     - high SLAs
  - Purchasing Models
    - DTU
      - guarantees a minimum level of compute memory and IO resources
      - bundled measure of compute storage and IO resources
      - best for customers who want simple pre-configured resources options
      - simplifies database resource provisioning by giving the consumer only two levelers
        - computing performacne
        - data storage
      - only available with single instance databases and elastic pool
    - vCore
      - Best for consumers who need flexibility and control
      - Allows you to use Azure Hybrid Benefit to reduce license costs
      - Supported in all three deployment options
      - independent scaling of compute storage and IO resources
  - Service Tiers
    - General Purpose or Standard
    - Business Critical or Premium
    - Hyperscale

2. Business Continuity
  - means continuing to provide services in the event of a disaster or service interruption
  - High Availability and Disaster Recovery
    - Log Shipping
      - allows for database logs to be shipped to a warm or cold standby server
    - Azure Blob Storage databases are backed up directly to Blob storage in a different datacenter for disaster recovery
    - Replication with Azure Site Recovery
      - Production SQL Server instance in one Azure datacenter replicated directly to Azure Sotrage in a differernt Azure datacenter for disaster recovery
    - Standard Availability Model
    - Premium Availability Model
    - Zone Redundant Configurations

3. Security
  - Network Security
  - Access Management
  - Threat Protection
  - Information Protection
